<p class="govuk-body">DIT encourages anyone who must go into an office and who
does not have symptoms of COVID-19 to volunteer for a lateral flow test at a
testing site.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If you work at a DIT London office, then you can <a
href="https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/civil-service-asymptomatic-testing-site-queen-elizabeth-conference-centre-tickets-138450835175">book
an appointment</a> at the civil service workplace asymptomatic testing site at
the QEII Conference Centre just off Parliament Square.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If you regularly need to attend the office, from 2 to 5
days a week, we recommend testing twice a week with at least 48 hours between
tests.</p>

<p class="govuk-body">If you need to attend for an occasional visit, we
recommend you get a test on the day of attendance, before attending the office
if possible.</p>
